            <h2>Why is this annual music event still so important?</h2>
            <p>Now in its 37th year, the Carolina Beach Music Festival brings with it seeds of history that began eight decades ago. Back in the 1940's, just over the bridge from Carolina Beach, was a community known as Seabreaze, the legendary and rightful birthplace of "beach music"- the genesis of a sound that transformed the musical soundscape of the south.</p>
            <p>The community of Seabreaze had establishments better known as "juke joints", airing the harmonious sounds of Bebop, Boogie, Rhythm and Blues, and Swing music- all being played from a jukeboxox. Carolina Beach was a haven for dance halls, better known as "jump joints", during the 40's, playing music that originated from the Seabreeze "juke joints", and a new dance craze was born; "The Shag". Shag is a type of swing dance combining fancy footwork with upbeat rhythm and blues better known today as "Beach Music".</p>
            <p>Whether you come to dance or just sit back and enjoy the live beach music, our event offers something for all. The festival takes place on the beach at the Carolina Beach Boardwalk and is the longest running beach music festival in the United States that is still held on the beach.</p>
            <p>Your Pleasure Island Chamber of Commerce invites you and your family to join us on Saturday, June 3, 2023 for the 37th Annual Carolina Beach Music Festival that will draw beach music enthusiasts from across the East Coast to enjoy a day of great music, dancing, sunshine and some of the best eating establishments Carolina Beach and Pleasure Island have to offer.</p>
